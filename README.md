**Ad-Hoc** - _A new or undocumented process is uncontrolled, reactive and unpredictable, typically driven by individuals without coordination or communication. Success depends on individual heroics._

**Managed** - _A process is partially documented, possibly leading to consistent results. Success depends on discipline._	

**Defined** - _A process is documented, standardized, and integrated into other processes. Success depends on automation.	_

**Measured** - _The process is quantitatively managed. Success depends on measuring metrics against business goals._	

**Optimized** - _The process is continually and reliably improving through both incremental and innovative changes. Success depends on reducing the risk of change._
