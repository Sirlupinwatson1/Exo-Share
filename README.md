# Getting Started with Open Source and Exo-Share

Welcome to our course on **Getting Started with Open Source and Exo-Share**. We are excited to join you in this journey and look forward to helping you to make the world of Open Source better!

### How It Works

This is not your average training course. This is a self-guided journey, where we will be supporting you and your team in creating the necessary documents to define and communicate your Open Source idea and share your knowledge with the world.

We like to call this repository **Share Yourself**. It doesn't look like much right now, but when we are done with this repository, you will move it to your own idea and GitHub organization where it will become a resource for the developers inside your group or friend, family who are using, contributing or releasing Open Source projects.

This is a **learning** repository, but at the same time its the beginning of the quest. You will see that the more you let your brain free the best part is, even though these Issues and Pull Requests,will be the first step of your Exo-Share Profile -- and serve as a treasure trove of information -- for those who join the repository later.  

### Getting Started

We hope you are excited to get started! Head over to the take your first steps toward : Exo-Share : Open Source program for your company.
